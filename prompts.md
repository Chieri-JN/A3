# List of LLM Prompts used and the given output
This is meant for any code snippets that were completely or partially generated by an LLM. The list does not include all prompts

 - ***"how do I calculate the 80 percentiles (10% to 90%)"*** (I was given multiple methods but ended up using the D3 one)

    *D3 has built-in quantile utilities if you‚Äôre already using D3:*
    ```javascript
    import * as d3 from "d3";
    
    const usAqiValues = data.map(d => d.usAqi).sort(d3.ascending);
    
    const p10 = d3.quantile(usAqiValues, 0.10);
    const p90 = d3.quantile(usAqiValues, 0.90);
    ```

- ***"for d3 map, can I do a specific county in PA"***
>   Yes ‚úÖ ‚Äî you *absolutely* can render **a specific county in Pennsylvania** using D3!
    The general idea is this: you‚Äôll load **GeoJSON or TopoJSON** data for counties, **filter to the one you want**, and then **draw it with D3‚Äôs geo projection + path generator**.
    Let‚Äôs go step-by-step üëá
    ## üß© 1Ô∏è‚É£ Get county boundary data
    
    You can get Pennsylvania counties in several ways:
    
    * **From the US Census Bureau:**
    
      * [https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html)
      * Choose: ‚ÄúCounty‚Äù, 1:5m or 1:20m, and state FIPS = 42 (for Pennsylvania)
      * **From public GitHub sources** (e.g., [deldersveld/topojson](https://github.com/deldersveld/topojson)) which already has PA counties TopoJSON.
      * Or load **all U.S. counties** from `@public/us-atlas` and filter down.
    
    Example:
    
    ```js
    import { feature } from "topojson-client";
    import * as d3 from "d3";
    import usData from "us-atlas/counties-10m.json" assert { type: "json" };
    
    const counties = feature(usData, usData.objects.counties).features;
    ```
    
    Then filter to the Pennsylvania counties:
    
    ```js
    // Pennsylvania's FIPS state code is "42"
    const paCounties = counties.filter(d => d.id.startsWith("42"));
    ```
    
    If you only want one county (say, **Allegheny County**):
    
    ```js
    const allegheny = paCounties.find(d => d.properties.NAME === "Allegheny");
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ## üß© 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set up your projection and path
    
    ```js
    const width = 600, height = 400;
    
    const projection = d3.geoAlbersUsa()
    .fitSize([width, height], allegheny);
    
    const path = d3.geoPath(projection);
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ## üß© 3Ô∏è‚É£ Draw it
    
    ```js
    const svg = d3.select("svg")
    .attr("width", width)
    .attr("height", height);
    
    svg.append("path")
    .datum(allegheny)
    .attr("d", path)
    .attr("fill", "lightblue")
    .attr("stroke", "black");
    ```
    
    ‚úÖ This renders just that county‚Äôs outline.
    
    ---
    
    ## üß© 4Ô∏è‚É£ Optional: add labels or data
    
    ```js
    svg.append("text")
    .attr("x", width / 2)
    .attr("y", height - 10)
    .attr("text-anchor", "middle")
    .text(allegheny.properties.NAME);
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ### ‚ö° TL;DR
    
    1. Get a **GeoJSON/TopoJSON** file containing U.S. or PA counties.
       2. Use D3/TopoJSON to **filter** to your target county (e.g., `"Allegheny"`).
       3. Use a **projection** like `geoAlbersUsa()` and draw with `geoPath()`.
       4. Style it however you want.
    
    ---
    
    If you tell me **which county** you want (e.g., ‚ÄúPhiladelphia‚Äù, ‚ÄúAllegheny‚Äù, ‚ÄúLancaster‚Äù), I can give you a **ready-to-run D3 example** that renders just that county with working GeoJSON and coordinates.
    
    Would you like me to do that?
