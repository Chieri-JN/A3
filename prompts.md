- ***"for the following code, why is tha opacity of the bands at the start (before the first toggle) are different from subsequent toggles of showRawData"***
    ```javascript

        const svg = d3.select(svgElem)
            .selectAll("*")
            .remove(); // clear everything
    ```
 - ***"how do I calculate the 80 percentiles (10% to 90%)"*** (I was given multiple methods but ended up using the D3 one)

    *D3 has built-in quantile utilities if youâ€™re already using D3:*
    ```javascript
    import * as d3 from "d3";
    
    const usAqiValues = data.map(d => d.usAqi).sort(d3.ascending);
    
    const p10 = d3.quantile(usAqiValues, 0.10);
    const p90 = d3.quantile(usAqiValues, 0.90);
    ```

- ***"is possible to do a background map of a state in the US in d3"***
